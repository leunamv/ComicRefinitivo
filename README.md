# UT Convocatoria Final
APLICATION : COMICS1.


The application is a simple list of comics with their author. In which data can be entered and modified to taste. This connects to a database and loads, modifies, deletes etc the data.
It has a simple interface (in two months of work I think very dense things have been done) and it is very indicative.
